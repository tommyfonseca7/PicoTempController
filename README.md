# PicoW Temperature controller

This project was developed as part of the Cyber-Physical Systems course in the Computer Engineering Master's program at FCUL. 
The project focuses on developing a control application that can regulate the temperature inside a house. This is an important task to improve the comfort of the house while trying to reduce the energy required to achieve such improvement.
Two controllers were developed: a Simple On-Off controller and a PID controller. 
Additionally, the server has three open ports: port 80 for the website, port 4444 for sensor data transfer, and port 5555 for all actuator controls.
